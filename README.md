# CARE-THE-TEMPERATURE
This project keeps monitoring the tempreature of a room/chamber, whenever the temperature rises the threshold , we get an alert, whenever an anomaly is dected, we get an alert and also whenever it is predicted that the temperature will cross upper threshold or lower threshold, we get an alert (all alerts on telegram because it's easy with telegram). Also this project is a prototype how we can control the temperature using a 5V dc fan with variable speeds. Workers are alerted using LEDs and buzzer.
