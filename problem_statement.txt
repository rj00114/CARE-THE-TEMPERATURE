Medicine manufacturing:

1) While the manufacturer is allowed to maintain the temperature of the tablets between,
-40 and -30 degrees Celsius, the temperature of the tablets should never remain
between -33 and -30 degrees for longer than 20 minutes at a time.
2) Also, the manufacturer should maintain a log of when the cooling chamber for the
production of the tablets is opened.

Objectives:
Write the product code, required to run the polynomial regression algorithm on the data
sent by the sensor.
Using the prediction data, we should be able to take early action, whenever the graph predicted that the temperature would be maintained within
the -33 and -30 degrees Celsius range for longer than 20 minutes.
a) Keep the temperature monitoring circuit inside your fridge with the door of the fridge
closed, and let the system record the temperature readings for about 2 hours.
b) Using the reading that you received in the 2 hours, set boundaries for the temperature
within the fridge.
c) Write a python code which will fetch the temperature data, every 10 seconds, and send
out an Telegram alert, if the temperature goes beyond the temperature thresholds you
decided on in objective ‘b’.
d) Modify the python code, to also do a Z-score analysis and print the line “Someone has
opened the fridge door” when an anomaly is detected.
